Hi, there ðŸ‘‹. Thanks for your stay in `this repo <https://github.com/Spico197/DocEE>`_.

This project aims at building a universal toolkit for extracting events
automatically from documents ðŸ“„ (long texts).

ðŸ”¥ We have an online demo: http://hlt.suda.edu.cn/docee (available in 9:00-17:00 UTC+8).

Currently, this repo contains ``PTPCG``, ``Doc2EDAG`` and ``GIT`` models,
and these models are all designed for document-level event extraction without triggers.
Documents are under construction.
More models are planned to be added.

Issue, PR and document contributions are warmly welcomed to make this project nicer.
